# PII Detection & Redaction System 🔒

A comprehensive web application for detecting and redacting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from documents and text. Built with modern web technologies and AI-powered NER models.

## 🚀 Features

### Core Functionality
- **Multi-format Document Processing**: Supports PDF, DOCX, TXT, and image files
- **Advanced PII Detection**: Uses AI-powered Named Entity Recognition (NER) to detect:
  - Names and person entities
  - Email addresses
  - Phone numbers
  - Social Security Numbers (SSN)
  - Credit card numbers
  - Addresses and locations
  - Driver's license numbers
  - Passport numbers
  - Bank account numbers
  - Employee IDs
  - Dates of birth
- **Smart Redaction**: Automatically replaces detected PII with anonymized tokens (e.g., [NAME_1], [EMAIL_1])
- **Multiple Export Formats**: Export results as TXT, JSON, CSV, or PDF
- **Real-time Processing**: Live preview of detection and redaction results

### Technical Features
- **OCR Processing**: Extract text from scanned documents and images using Tesseract.js
- **Confidence Scoring**: Each detected entity includes confidence levels (High/Medium/Low)
- **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple documents simultaneously
- **Secure Backend**: Supabase integration with Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices

## 💡 Usage

### 1. Upload Documents
- Drag and drop files or click to select
- Supported formats: PDF, DOCX, TXT, JPG, PNG
- Files are processed automatically

### 2. Review Detection Results
- View detected PII entities with confidence scores
- Entities are categorized by risk level (High/Medium/Low)
- Preview redacted text in real-time

### 3. Export Results
- Choose from multiple export formats:
  - **TXT**: Plain text with redacted content
  - **JSON**: Structured data with all detection metadata
  - **CSV**: Tabular format for analysis
  - **PDF**: Professional document format

### 4. Manage Processing History
- View previously processed documents
- Re-export results in different formats
- Track processing statistics

## 🔧 Configuration

### NER Model Configuration
The system uses Hugging Face's transformer models for entity detection. You can modify the model settings in `src/utils/ner.ts`:

```typescript
const MODEL_NAME = 'Xenova/bert-base-NER';
```

### Redaction Patterns
Custom regex patterns for PII detection can be modified in the processing utilities.

## 🔒 Security Features

- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Database-level access control
- **Secure File Handling**: Files are processed securely without permanent storage
- **Data Privacy**: No sensitive data is logged or stored unnecessarily
- **HTTPS Only**: All communications are encrypted

## 🚀 Deployment

### Deploy to Production
